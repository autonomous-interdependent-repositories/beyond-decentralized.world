                            As it stands right now, repositories are linked via @ManyToOne relationships. This is easy
                            to do since the Many side of the relationship contains the foreign key into the parent
                            table. However, as I've been writing the first internally provided DApps I realized that
                            there is a need for linking from the @OneToMany side as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This can be demonstrated with linking from a Goal to Tasks. Naturally it makes sense to move
                            the Goal and its underlying Tasks into separate repositories. This is true because a Task is
                            more focused and only needs to be shared with stakeholders that care about that particular
                            task. Versus a Goal can be shared by many more people and needs to be shared across all of
                            them. But when performing a UI navigation between a Goal and its tasks (from the Goal side
                            of the relationship) by default there would be no way to discover the Repositories of the
                            related tasks. This is because there is no way to store state of the @OneToMany relationship
                            without the child records on the Many side of the relationship:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>@Entity()
                            <b>export class</b> Goal <b>extends</b> AirEntity {

                        name: string

                        @OneToMany({ mappedBy: 'goal' })
                        tasks: Task[]

                        }

                        @Entity()
                        <b>export class</b> Task <b>extends</b> AirEntity {

                        @ManyToOne()
                        goal: Goal

                        }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            As you can see the @OneToMany relationship has to specify the "mappedBy" property to link to
                            the
                            field that it's being mapped to. This is because in the underlying table the linking
                            identifier
                            lives in the table with the @ManyToOne (the Tasks table in the example above).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So, when you make a Repository split between a Goal and its Tasks, by default the Goal
                            Repository won't have any way to know about Tasks that are not physically present on the
                            same
                            user database.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Default solution - new Table
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            My default solution to this was to create a new @ManyToMany table that contains links to
                            both
                            the Goal and the Task:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>@Entity()
                            <b>export class</b> GoalTask <b>extends</b> AirEntity {

                        @ManyToOne()
                        goal: Goal

                        @ManyToOne()
                        task: Task

                        }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            And (subsequently) to change the @OneToMany relationship in the Goal to this new table:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>@Entity()
                            <b>export class</b> Goal <b>extends</b> AirEntity {

                        name: string

                        @OneToMany({ mappedBy: 'goal' })
                        goalTasks: GoalTask[]

                        }
                        </code></pre>
                        <p>
                            While leaving the direct link from Task to Goal in place. This solved the problem of the
                            Goal
                            Repository being able to look up Task repositories, without having Task repositories loaded
                            in
                            the local database. But this moved the burden of maintaining this relationship onto the App
                            developers, which is cumbersome, error prone (developers can forget to do this) and is
                            definitely annoying. With AIRport priding itself on being developer friendly this is not an
                            acceptable solution in the final version of AIRport must be mitigated in a better way before
                            AIRport is open to third party Apps.

                            Copying records breaks data encapsulation.
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            One way to approach this issue is to copy records from the @ManyToOne side of the
                            relationship
                            into the repository in the OneToMany side. However this just doesn't work with the idea of
                            data
                            encapsulation. While it is OK (and probably a good idea) for a Task to know about its parent
                            Goal, not all Tasks should be visible from the Goal side view, at least not in some
                            settings.
                            The end user should have the ability to specify Tasks that are private and are not visible
                            to
                            all Goal participants. For example, the goal of "Have a Merry Christmas" should have the
                            task of
                            "Put presents under the tree" be shared between the parents and Santa Claus. Children should
                            have no knowledge of what it took to get those presents there.
                        </p>
                        <h2>
                            Internalize the ManyToMany
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            So, the obvious solution then is to Internalize the @ManyToMany table and relationship. This
                            means that for every relationship in the schema there will be a hidden @ManyToMany table. It
                            will always be populated and maintained (on @ManyToOne deletions or manual parent key swaps
                            or
                            key removal, I'm still not sure on deletions from @OneToMany arrays causing relationship
                            changes). All queries from the One side of every relationship will (under the good) join via
                            the
                            @ManyToMany table, while the joins from the Many side will still join directly to the One
                            side
                            of the table. All of this will be hidden from the developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This can present unnecessary framework bloat when developers really mean to create an
                            Application level ManyToMany table but is a necessary step to keep things uniform and to not
                            expose unneeded complexity to App developers.

                            Relationship maintenance
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The other thing that will have to happen to make this work is (as described above)
                            maintenance
                            of these hidden tables when a @ManyToOne relationship is removed (by either deleting the
                            @ManyToOne record or moving record to another @OneToMany). While deletion is
                            straightforward,
                            moving to a different parent record is more complex and actually stands on its own - it has
                            to
                            be done even without the new hidden tables in place. The solution is rather trivial though,
                            since the foreign to the @OneToMany isn't part of the record key itself. This key can just
                            be
                            changed (or removed if made null). The only additional task is to maintain the Original key
                            (which will be renamed to Cross Repository key) and to change it (or null it out) as well.

                        <p>
                            This opens up the way to implement @OneToOne relationships, which can also span multiple
                            Repositories. For '@OneToOne's there will have to be a foreign key on both sides of the
                            relationship, this truly making it a 'one-to-one' relationship with the JOINs being
                            specified on
                            both keys (vs synthetic relationships that are commonly present in modern ORMs).

                            However the @OneToOne relationship isn't strictly necessary and won't be in the initial
                            release
                            of AIRport (and thus won't be in the first public version of Turbase.app).

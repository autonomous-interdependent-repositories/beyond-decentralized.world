Option for keeping old data:

1.  Maintain multiple versions of the underlying schema with
separate records in them.
2.  Add a version field into the foreign keys
3.  Join records across multiple version - in queries


Q:  How to migrate records

Will upgrade script be required in any scenario?

Q:  Maybe just limit the upgrades to things that don't
break legacy:

1.  Don't allow table removal
2.  Don't allow column removal
3.  Don't allow table renaming or removal
4.  Don't allow new non-null columns without default values

Probably the limiting route the the most sensible one at
this point, especially if no funding can be obtained to
resarch other options.

Ultimately - more resarch needs to be done into what is
the best way.

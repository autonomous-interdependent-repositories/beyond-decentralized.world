In 2015 I wrote a family organizer.  I wanted everyone to use it but soon realized that I would have to host the data on a central server.

That meant that other families would have to trust me with that data.  It also meant that I would be tempted to sell that data to make a profit.

That completely blocked me from proceeding with my goal and for several months I did not see a way around this problem.

After some thinking I finally realized that data could be stored on existing online platforms in individual user accounts.  It wasn't perfect but it worked.

Energized by this idea I started writing a framework.  After several years of development and many conceptual breakthroughs I'm ready to share it with the world.

I think this new way of sharing data is the future of decentralized Application development.  You can click on the link below to learn the technical details.

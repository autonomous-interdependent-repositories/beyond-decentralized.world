Hello, I am Artem Shamsutdinov and this is a story of Beyond Decentralized.

In 2015 I decided to use my programming skills and I write an App I could sell.  I saw a need for better personal organization tools and wrote an organizer that I humorously called Hans the Organizator.

I wanted everyone to use it but soon realized that I would have to host the data on a central server.

That meant that other families would have to trust me with that data.

It also meant that I would be tempted to sell that data to make a profit.

That completely blocked me from proceeding with my goal.

For several months I did not see a way around this problem.

I kept on thinking about the problem and finally found a possible solution.

I realized that user data could be stored on existing online platforms in individual user accounts.  It wasn't perfect but it was worth a shot.

Energized by this idea I started writing a framework.  At first it was just a simple data storage adapter.

But as I kept on working on it the idea kept on growing.  It took me several years to build all of the features required for it to work.

For a while I've known that this technology can be the future of decentralized Application development.

Now in 2022 I realize this it can be a begining of a decentralized Internet of Databases.

Beyond Decentralized stack enables decentralized application
interoperability on top of relational databases. It brings
standard Client-Server-Database development model
to decentralized application development.

Relational databases are split into autonomous Repositories.
Each Repository maintains its own blockchain.  Repositories
are loaded into databases on user devices and are stored
on decentralized storage platforms like IPFS and Arweave (as
transaction logs).

Apps run in isolated VMs and can interoperate.  Apps
can directly query data in other apps (by writing joins to
tables of other apps) but must call APIs of other Apps to
make persistence operations on tables of those Apps.

Beyond Decentralized stack brings standard ORM & API tooling
and bridges the client server gap with a modern entity
management scheme. It supports entity based, declarative data
validation.

The framework and apps can run entirely in the browser or as a
native application.  Beyond Decentralized is working toward
a goal of an Internet of Databases. To find out more please see

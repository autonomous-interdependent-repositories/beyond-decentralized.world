              structures data in relational tables and exposes it's structure as <a

              Developers are able to read these schemas and understand how data is structured.
              In turn applications are able
              to join data across multiple schemas and present it to the users.

            <p class="lead">Initial project deals with data decentralization.
              Upcoming and planned efforts are Beyond Decentralized.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport">AIRport</a> is
                the founding project of Beyond Decentralized. It manages data Repositories
                and controls data access by Applications. It provides:
                <ul>
                  <li>Object Relational Mapping</li>
                  <li>Query and Persistence layer</li>
                  <li>Application VM management</li>
                  <li>Repository access and maintenance</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                AIRport runs entirely in-browser and can also run as a native application
                on end user devices.
              </li>
              <li>Highway is an upcoming project meant to let large organizations
                work on data owned by local communities. It allows shared data
                to be housed by locally owned franchises and integrates with AIRport
                for user owned data. Its development is driven by the idea that
                international corporations can harmoniously work with locally
                owned community data and personal data. It will take application
                interoperability into the distributed world, beyond what data
                decentralization can offer.
              </li>
              <li>Maglev is a future project. It's about letting any number
                of organizations fairly and securely access community owned data.
                It is meant to help existing organizations plug into locally
                sovereign data as well as group and personal data.

          <!-- The Story
		============================ -->
          <section id="the-story">
            <h3>The Story of Beyond Decentralized</h3>
            <p>
              In 2015 I wrote "Hans the Organizator" (a family organizer)
              and realized that families would have to store data on someone else's
              servers. So I set off to first write an adapter for cloud storage
              where people could store data under their own accounts. Over time
              that adapter grew to become AIRport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then a conceptual breakthrough came - I realized that Applications
              can inter-operate on user data. Since the data is stored and owned by
              the users, Applications only access it to provide functionality.
              Apps can use each other's schemas and share data right on end user's
              devices, without ever taking it off the device. That separated
              Application concerns from Data concerns and (at least for me)
              changed how applications can be written.
            </p>
            <p>
              All along I had the idea that globally shared data can also be stored
              and used in a fair way. The idea there centered around a large
              organization using data that stays in the communities
              where it originated. Under that umbrella 3rd party applications
              can be written that also use the same data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Autonomous Interdependent Repositories allow any number of databases
              (of any size) to be joined on demand on execution nodes.
              Now (in 2022) <a href="https://beyond-decentralized.world/2022/Beyond_Decentralized.html">I realized</a>
              that it is possible to combine multiple large databases on a
              network of independently operated execution nodes. This means that large
              organizations can interoperate in a fair data ecosystem.

            <p class="lead mb-5">
              Autonomous Interdependent Repositories are about taking relational data
              and breaking it up into pieces that can be shared across devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This works because there is always a limit to the dataset that is
              being presented to the user at a given time. For example a thread
              on a forum is a unit of data. Repository represents that dataset.
              Repositories are meant to be small and focused.
            </p>
            <p>During the design
              process of an Application, if the planned repositories are getting
              too big that means that they should be split up further. For
              example one part of the screen can be covered by one Repository
              while another part of the screen is backed by a second Repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also possible to have repositories with aggregate data
              computed based on contents of other repositories.

              All records in Repositories are identified by 3 keys:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Repository GUID</b> - a globally unique identifier for the
                repository
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Actor GUID</b> - a globally unique identifier for the
                "Actor" that created the record.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Actor Record ID</b> - a numeric identifier unique to
                the actor (normally unique the the physical database on which
                the record was created)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              "Actor" is a given User, using a given Application on a particular
              physical Database/Device. In practice it Actor is even more
              specific:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A given <b>User</b> - identified by an email address.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a given <b>Application</b> - identified by the URL of
                the Application (domain + path)
              </li>
              <li>
                via a particular <b>Client</b> - identified
                by the domain of the Client (Ex: "a-user-interface.com")
              </li>
              <li>
                on a particular <b>Database</b> - identified by a random GUID
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The distinction between Application and Client is there because
              Applications run in controlled environments (IFrames with different
              domains, within the AIRport tab), while Clients are the UIs that
              use AIRports.

            <p>
              When stored on shared file systems or NoSQL databases Repositories are

                  <b>Operation History</b> - records an operation
                  in a particular relational table. It has the schema and table names,

            <h3>AIR - Autonomous</h3>
            <p>Repositories are <b>Autonomous</b> because each Repository
              contains all of the information needed to be useful. That is,
              it can be used by itself, without any other Repositories. This
              refers to the fact that Repositories may reference each other's
              records. That is, a record in one Repository may have a
              foreign key to a record in another Repository.
            </p>
            <p>To make repositories fully autonomous all records from other
              Repositories get copied to the Repository with the foreign keys.
              The copied records have the state of the original records as it
              was when it was first referenced via a foreign keys. The new
              record copies may then be updated and may diverge from the
              state of the records they were copied from.
            </p>
            <p>The copy process is repeated for all records that are, in turn,
              pointed to by the foreign keys in the copied records. This means
              that no matter how deep the foreign key references go, they
              all get copied into the Repository with the top level
              foreign key.
            </p>
            <p>This has the effect of making sure that Joins (made on the
              tables where the Repository resides) always return data
              for the views to display. Thus, a Repository may be loaded
              (and will always be usable) by itself, even if it has nested
              references to records in many other Repositories.

            <p>When the records are copied into a Repository from
              other Repositories, the original <b>Repository GUID</b>,
              <b>Actor GUID</b> and <b>Actor Record Id</b> are retained
              in separate columns. Along with them, the global address of the
              Repository is retained as well, allowing AIRport to
              lookup that Repository (where the copied records came
              from).
            </p>
            <p>These "original" Ids are retained in another set of keys
              that do not have foreign key constraints on them. AIRport
              can then be instructed to take a given Query and run it
              in cross-Repository mode. When doing so AIRport
              will use LEFT JOINs and progressively load missing
              Repositories and re-query until it returns complete
              object graphs with all of the records from the original
              Repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
              The query process may be slow (due to necessary network
              round trips to retrieve additional Repositories) but
              may be served via Observables, allowing the UIs to
              progressively load more data as it becomes available.
            </p>
            <p>Thus Repositories are <b>Interdependent</b> and the UIs
              can make the choice of viewing the Repository-local
              data only, or loading the cross-Repository view,
              that may at first return Repository-local data and
              then can fill in the data across referenced
              Repositories.

              original state of the entity. When the entities are saved, AIRport
              calculates diffs on the entity objects (using the original object
              state) and performs the necessary updates. Tracking original state
              removes the need for maintaining Hibernate-like ORM sessions and
              insulates edited objects from possible state overwrites (due to remotely
              made updates to the same objects).

            <h3>API</h3>
            <p>
              AIRport Apps run in isolated VMs inside AIRport. Clients (UIs)
              communicate with Apps via AIRport:
            </p>
            <img src="./images/AIRport_architectural_diagram.drawio.png" class="img-fluid"
              alt="AIRport Client to App communication">
            <p>
              Apps define API methods by decorating them with @Api() decorator.
              AIRport generates SOAP like stubs for Clients and other Apps
              to use. Invoking those stubs sends requests to AIRport which
              forwards them to Apps where they are from (loading missing Apps
              when necessary).
              The default import of an Application contains just the API
              stubs. A separate bundle is created for Application itself (and
              is deployed a standardized URL for AIRport to load into IFrames).
            </p>
            <p>
              App VMs are run in IFrames. Because Application server domains
              differ, Apps are isolated from AIRport and other Apps (from
              different domains). The only way Apps can interact with
              AIRport and other Apps is via the API framework defined
              by AIRport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apps cannot directly access the relational database
              hosted by AIRport and must make standardized persistence requests
              (via provided ORMs) that are pre-processed and sanitized by
              AIRport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apps can join to tables in schemas of other Apps. Apps cannot
              directly modify data in schemas that belong to other Apps.
              Apps must call APIs defined by other Apps to make data
              modifications (in schemas of those other Apps).

          <!-- Validation

          <section id="AIRport-Validation">
            <h3>Validation</h3>
            <p>
              AIRport is designed to bridge the client-server gap.
              Objects passed as parameters to API calls retain all changes when returned
              to the Client. And, objects passed into DAO.save methods are automatically
              updated to the saved state. Thus, there is no need the the Client to query for
              the new entity state (of the just saved entity objects). That state is
              automatically updated in the parameter object passed from the Client (the
              objects that were send to the API to be saved).
            </p>
            <p>
              Likewise, AIRport integrates data in the opposite (Client to Server)
              direction. The entity objects returned by APIs contain their original
              (previous) state (in a hidden/private property). The Client make
              modifications to objects and sends them back. DAO.save calls then use the
              original (previous) state to determine which properties where modified.
              If the passed-in objects don't have the original state (or IDs) they are
              treated as new objects. DAO.save calls will persist all objects in the
              passed in object trees that are new/updated/to be deleted (as long as
              those objects are in the schema of the Application).
            </p>
            <p>This seamless integration of client and server requires strict validation
              of all data that is passed into Application APIs. Validating via standard
              procedural calls is both verbose and error prone. AIRport includes
              a <a href="https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport/tree/master/libs/airbridge/validate">
                library</a> that abstracts away the CRUD of validating API inputs.
            </p>
            <p>
              AIRport validation leverages the Database Entity definitions and provides
              a type safe API that declaratively describes the desired (valid)
              state of the passed in entity tree. AIRport provides a validation DSL (in
              the form of
              validation functions, tied to the JSON entity tree declaration).
              All passed in state that is not validated is automatically flagged.
              All objects that are not validated are excluded from persistence operations.
              Non-validated properties (with new/modified values) on validated objects
              cause validation to fail.

              Every API call that goes through AIRport get's its own
              savepoint. This means that if an API method fails and
              throws an Error, all of its database operations (and
              operations of API methods it itself called) will be
              rolled back. If an API method is wrapped in a
              "try {} catch(e) {}" block, catching the Error will
              allow the calling API method to do additional processing
              (and database operations) even if its nested API calls
              failed.
            </p>

              Currently, API methods called within

              Transaction tracking is implemented behind the scenes,
              without requiring the developers to pass transaction objects
              around. In the same way request information for an API
              operation is also implemented in the background. API
              services and DAOs can just:

              where locally operated (where possible community owned)
              franchises host community data.
            </p>
            <p>Technologically this can be accomplished by leveraging
              existing technologies such as globally shardable
              <a href="https://www.cockroachlabs.com/">
                CockroachDB</a> and <a href="https://www.scylladb.com/">
                ScyllaDB</a>. Autonomous Interdependent repositories
              are used for integration with private user data,
              for performance benefits and to provide an eventual
              migration path to <a href="#maglev">Maglev</a>.

            <p>
              Highway will work by sending modification requests to the
              server, where they will be processed and placed into
              a distributed relational database. Because Highway
              data is stored in Repositories, read queries will go
              against a wide column store. Transaction logs will be
              pulled into the client-side AIRport engine where
              relational data will be reconstructed and queried. AIRport
              will monitor incoming transaction log entries and serve
              data via Observable feeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Highway will allow Applications from multiple providers
              to access and add to community owned data (access across
              schemas and modify in Application's own schema). Eventually
              this will be done based on rules specified by the
              community owned hosting franchises.
            </p>
            <p>
              Applications will run in VMs and will have access to
              only the APIs specified by AIRport, thus preventing
              abuse of community data.

              Maglev is AIR across organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maglev is about allowing organizations that interoperate
              in an ecosystem of Repositories.

              AIRport can run on a trusted network of execution nodes
              (a la blockchain validator nodes) and work with Repositories
              from multiple Organizations. Running AIRport on execution
              nodes ensures fairness and security of data processing and
              protects organizations and their data. AIRport can
              enforce data sharing and modification rules specified by
              each organization and allow Organization and third party
              Applications access (organization and community owned) data.
              AIRport execution nodes can work in concert with
              Client-side AIRport engines to give combined decentralized
              and "organization distributed" data views to the user.

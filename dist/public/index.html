                database</a> technology. It
              structures data in relational tables and exposes it's structure as <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema">schemas</a>.
              Developers are able to read these schemas and understand how data is structured.
              In turn applications are able
              to join data across multiple schemas and present it to the users.

              Repositories reside on user's devices in relational databases. Repository

            <p class="lead">Initial project deals with data decentralization.
              Upcoming and planned efforts are Beyond Decentralized.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/beyond-decentralized/AIRport">AIRport</a> is
                the founding project of Beyond Decentralized. It manages data Repositories
                and controls data access by Applications. It provides:
                <ul>
                  <li>Object Relational Mapping</li>
                  <li>Query and Persistence layer</li>
                  <li>Application VM management</li>
                  <li>Repository access and maintenance</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                AIRport runs entirely in-browser and can also run as a native application
                on end user devices.
              </li>
              <li>Highway is an upcoming project meant to let large organizations
                work on data owned by local communities. It allows shared data
                to be housed by locally owned franchises and integrates with AIRport
                for user owned data. Its development is driven by the idea that
                international corporations can harmoniously work with locally
                owned community data and personal data. It will take application
                interoperability into the distributed world, beyond what data
                decentralization can offer.
              </li>
              <li>Maglev is a future project. It's about letting any number
                of organizations fairly and securely access community owned data.
                It is meant to help existing organizations plug into locally
                sovereign data as well as group and personal data.

          <!-- The Story
		============================ -->
          <section id="the-story">
            <h3>The Story of Beyond Decentralized</h3>
            <p>In 2015 I wrote "Hans the Organizator" - a family organizer. As
              soon as I started thinking about hosting it I realized that families
              had to give up information on their daily activities and future
              plans. So I set off to first write an adapter for cloud storage
              where people could store data under their own accounts. Over time
              that adapter grew to become AIRport.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then a conceptual breakthrough came - I realized that Applications
              can inter-operate on user data. Since the data is stored and owned by
              the users, Applications only access it to provide functionality.
              Apps can use each other's schemas and share data right on end user's
              devices, without ever taking it off the device. That separated
              Application concerns from Data concerns and (at least for me)
              changed how applications can be written.
            </p>
            <p>All along I had the idea that globally shared data can also be stored
              and used in a fair way. The idea there centered around a large
              organization using data that stays in the communities
              where it originated. Under that umbrella 3rd party applications
              can be written that also use the same data.
            </p>
            Autonomous Interdependent Repositories allow any number of databases
            (of any size) to be joined on demand on execution nodes.
            Now (in 2022) <a href="https://beyond-decentralized.world/2022/Beyond_Decentralized.html">I realized</a>
            that it is possible to combine multiple large databases on a
            network of independently operated execution nodes. This means that large
            organizations can interoperate in a fair data ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>Autonomous Interdependent Repositories</h2>
            <p class="lead mb-5">
              Autonomous Interdependent Repositories are about taking relational data
              and breaking it up into pieces that can be shared across devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              This works because there is always a limit to the dataset that is
              being presented to the user at a given time. For example a thread
              on a forum is a unit of data. Repository represents that dataset.
              Repositories are meant to be small and focused.
            </p>
            <p>During the design
              process of an Application, if the planned repositories are getting
              too big that means that they should be split up further. For
              example one part of the screen can be covered by one Repository
              while another part of the screen is backed by a second Repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also possible to have repositories with aggregate data
              computed based on contents of other repositories.

            <p>
              Repositories are loaded into relational databases. A Repository can
              span any number of relational tables.

              Repository B1 spans both tables (and both schemas). Repository B2
              is contained in B__TABLE_I. Repository C1 only spans tables in App

            <h3>AIR - IDs</h3>
            <p>
              All records in Repositories are identified by 3 keys:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Repository GUID</b> - a globally unique identifier for the
                repository
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Actor GUID</b> - a globally unique identifier for the
                "Actor" that created the record.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Actor Record ID</b> - a numeric identifier unique to
                the actor (normally unique the the physical database on which
                the record was created)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              "Actor" is a given User, using a given Application on a particular
              physical Database/Device. In practice it Actor is even more
              specific:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A given <b>User</b> - identified by an email address.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a given <b>Application</b> - identified by the URL of
                the Application (domain + path)
              </li>
              <li>
                via a particular <b>Client</b> - identified
                by the domain of the Client (Ex: "a-user-interface.com")
              </li>
              <li>
                on a particular <b>Database</b> - identified by a random GUID
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The distinction between Application and Client is there because
              Applications run in controlled environments (IFrames with different
              domains, within the AIRport tab), while Clients are the UIs that
              use AIRports.

              stored as Transaction logs. Each repository gets its own independent
              transaction log. Transaction logs are structured as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Transaction History</b> - this is a record of the transaction, with a
                unique identifier and a timestamp of when the transaction took place.
                <ul>
                  <b>Operation History</b> - records an operation
                  in a particular relational table. It has the schema and table names,
                  the GUID of the <u>Actor</u> that performed this operation, the operation type (Create/Update/Delete)
                  and the order of that operation in the Transaction History.
                  <ul>
                    <b>Record History</b> - contains the <u>Actor GUID</u> and the
                    <u>Actor Record Id</u> for the record. The Actor GUID represents
                    the Actor that created the record and is needed for Update
                    and Delete operations (where the Actor in <u>Operation History</u>
                    may be a different one).
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Record History New Value</b> - has the column name
                        and the value that is being Inserted or Updated in that column
                        (for the record of the containing <u>Record history</u>)</li>
                      <li><b>Record History Old Value</b> - has the column name
                        and the value that is being Deleted or Replaced (with an Update
                        operation)</li>
                    </ul>

                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each Transaction History carries with it all of the information
              on the Actors that caused the operations in that transaction.
            </p>
            <div class="alert alert-info mb-4">
              <span class="badge badge-info text-uppercase">Note:</span> In
              practice, each operation also stores the API signature
              that was used to make that operation as well as the chain
              of all parent API calls (if any). This allows for Application
              discoverability by the users that are loading the Repository.
              AIRport can then suggest what Applications should be
              used to handle the Repository (and the Application descriptor can
              suggest what clients should be used to view the data).

            <h3>AIR - Autonomous</h3>
            <p>Repositories are <b>Autonomous</b> because each Repository
              contains all of the information needed to be useful. That is,
              it can be used by itself, without any other Repositories. This
              refers to the fact that Repositories may reference each other's
              records. That is, a record in one Repository may have a
              foreign key to a record in another Repository.
            </p>
            <p>To make repositories fully autonomous all records from other
              Repositories get copied to the Repository with the foreign keys.
              The copied records have the state of the original records as it
              was when it was first referenced via a foreign keys. The new
              record copies may then be updated and may diverge from the
              state of the records they were copied from.
            </p>
            <p>The copy process is repeated for all records that are, in turn,
              pointed to by the foreign keys in the copied records. This means
              that no matter how deep the foreign key references go, they
              all get copied into the Repository with the top level
              foreign key.
            </p>
            <p>This has the effect of making sure that Joins (made on the
              tables where the Repository resides) always return data
              for the views to display. Thus, a Repository may be loaded
              (and will always be usable) by itself, even if it has nested
              references to records in many other Repositories.
            </p>

            <h3>AIR - Interdependent</h3>
            <p>When the records are copied into a Repository from
              other Repositories, the original <b>Repository GUID</b>,
              <b>Actor GUID</b> and <b>Actor Record Id</b> are retained
              in separate columns. Along with them, the global address of the
              Repository is retained as well, allowing AIRport to
              lookup that Repository (where the copied records came
              from).
            </p>
            <p>These "original" Ids are retained in another set of keys
              that do not have foreign key constraints on them. AIRport
              can then be instructed to take a given Query and run it
              in cross-Repository mode. When doing so AIRport
              will use LEFT JOINs and progressively load missing
              Repositories and re-query until it returns complete
              object graphs with all of the records from the original
              Repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
              The query process may be slow (due to necessary network
              round trips to retrieve additional Repositories) but
              may be served via Observables, allowing the UIs to
              progressively load more data as it becomes available.
            </p>
            <p>Thus Repositories are <b>Interdependent</b> and the UIs
              can make the choice of viewing the Repository-local
              data only, or loading the cross-Repository view,
              that may at first return Repository-local data and
              then can fill in the data across referenced
              Repositories.

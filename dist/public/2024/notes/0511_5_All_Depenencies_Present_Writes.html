<p>
    To make a write on a repository all of its dependent repositories must be loaded.
    All queries made during a write transaction into a repository are limited to only the dependent repositories.
    Repository (or list of repositories) must be specified as an input to a write transaction.
</p>

<p>
    When combined with signed inputs and synced time agreement, this allows to verify
    that the data added to a Repository transaction log was indeed added through the
    logic of the apps involved in the transaction.

<h2>Needs more thought:</h2>
<p>
    To avoid repository version dependency deadlock there must be a system to sync repository
    versions across all of the dependencies of a given repository. Probably circular
    dependencies will be disallowed in Private repositories and in Open & Restricted
    repositories there must be a sync mechanism between the Write Logic servers.

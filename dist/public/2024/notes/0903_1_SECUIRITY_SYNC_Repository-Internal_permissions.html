Currently, there is no support for different permissions for different entities in a Repository. The Repository members
are granted either Read-only or Read-Write access to a given Repository. The idea behind this setup is that data is
already split into Repositories and should be granular. However, it is now becoming apparent that there are use cases
where certain types of modification operations may be allowed for certain Repository Members while other types of
modification operations may be allowed for other Repository Members on the same data, in the same Repository.
<br>
<br>
Accomplishing this level of access granularity is possible with the assumption that all AIRport databases will be
enforcing these access levels based on the permissions associated with the Repository Members. However, this does not
work if a user performs an operation and subsequently has their access reduced, or vice versa, if a user is granted
access but the access grant changes are not propagated across all member AIRport databases. This issue becomes apparent
in pure Peer-to-Peer environments where there isn't a single source synchronization and updates can come separately from
different sources.
<br>
<br>
A way to resolve this issue may be to delay the update processing until synchronization takes place. However, this can
block certain operations from happening, potentially deadlocking the User flow.
<br>
<br>
Here is a possible deadlock scenario:
<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        Administrator User grants access to User 2 to make modifications.
    </li>
    <li>
        User 2 makes changes to the Repository.
    </li>
    <li>
        User 3 receives the changes made by User 2 but does not receive the change made by the Administrator User
        that grants access to User 2.
    </li>
</ol>
Another way to get around this problem is to include the access grant record (signed by the known Administrator User)
along with every update operation. This will fix the issue as long as there isn't a synchronization issue with the
addition of Administrator privileges to the user granting access in the first place.
<br>
<br>
Thus without a synchronization guarantee, there may always be a scenario where User Access may be improperly blocked.
Hence pure Peer-to-Peer environments will not be supported in the initial releases. Perhaps, in pure Peer-to-Peer
networks, whenever the writing node is sharing the modifications made by a given Repository Member it will also share
the initial grant given to that Repository Member to make the change in the first place.
<br>
<br>
The presently expected setup is to have a group of server nodes that maintain a Repository Transaction Log with a high
degree of synchronization. With such a setup the chance of the perceived "Write before Access Grant" error should be
extremely small, thus enabling advanced in-Repository permission sets.

<h1>SYNC: Keeping Blocks</h1>
<br>
Maintaining previous and current values of fields in the Transaction Log history is expensive. However, this is required
for correct synchronization, especially in peer-to-peer environments.
<br>
<br>
Alpha and Beta software versions will run in the browser, purely in memory thus maintaining transaction log history is
very expensive. And in-browser versions will frequently sync so there needs to be a mechanism to clean out transaction
log history often - as soon as there is a confirmation of merge with the branch chain (for each Repository).
<br>
<br>
However, with frequent synchronization, conflicts will likely be rare. Another option is to keep un-merged blocks in
local storage and retrieve them back when a merge is required (if necessary). Given that the elected owner will provide
patch blocks for every un-merged branch this may not be required at all. If it will be required the blocks can be stored
in encrypted form and an expiring access cookie to the KeyRing Repository would be the only thing that would temporarily
allow access without a re-authentication action.
<br>
<br>
The long-term value of the in-browser version is that it has ephemeral storage - you can log in from any device and as
soon as the tab is closed (or in Chrome loses focus) your data is safe (maybe a PIN code will be required to access
decrypt the temporary access cookie).
<br>
<br>
As the framework advances, the Mobile App version of AIR-port will store the database on the File System so this won't
be as much of an issue. It will be the Mobile App version that will first enable true peer-to-peer support through Wi-Fi
connections (in-browser will require a server-side sync to get the IP address of all active nodes per Repository).

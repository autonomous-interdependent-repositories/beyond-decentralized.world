<h1>TECHNOLOGY - SqLite multiple databases</h1>
<br>
This may be useful during schema migrations (for non-backward compatible changes, if they are eventually supported):
<br>
<br>
SqLite allows multiple database files to be attached to the same SqLite runtime.
<br>
<br>
<br>
May be useful in servers, if we need to work on a Repository and its dependencies in isolation:
<br>
<br>
SqLite allows multiple connections, with each one capable of performing its own transaction. Thus multiple concurrent
transactions are supported. This, combined with loading multiple database files allows the same write (or other) node to
process multiple requests for different Repositories at the same time (with each one having its own in-memory database).

The idea is to validate that the user has a valid e-mail address as a base. This will be used to verify that they can
download their KeyRing Repository in the first place. Also when they pick their home region/metro area that email will
be associated with that region and their default data will be displayed from that region. This is needed going forward
to enable Votecube voting validation - they will only be eligible to vote in their region. Besides, email is already
trackable anyway, no need to obscure it - instead fix it at Metro Area association when audits and external security
tracking requirements come in.

Once the user's KeyRing Repository is retrieved they decrypt it on the client side using the password is specified. The
password itself will be encrypted in a special segment that will be encrypted using 3 to 5 security questions. This way
they will be able to recover in case of a lost password and re-encrypted with a new password.

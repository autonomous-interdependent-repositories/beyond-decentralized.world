Probably recorded already but jik: Storage of Transaction Logs (TL)s is needed on the server to ensure correct
processing across nodes (ensuring that records across repositories are recorded in the correct order), and for data
analytics (of open-access repositories). Once a TL Entry (TLE) is synced it can be safely deleted from the client.

Given that the regional (metro area) public servers will be in charge of syncing all Repositories (including private
ones, which just need to be in the right order, no matter that their TLEs are client-side encrypted and secret) there is
also no need for clients to run conflict detection. Thus there is no need to keep TLEs on the client for that reason
either.

Temporarily (off-line or until sync verification) stored TCEs shouldn't go into SqLite but be in file (IndexedDb)
storage.

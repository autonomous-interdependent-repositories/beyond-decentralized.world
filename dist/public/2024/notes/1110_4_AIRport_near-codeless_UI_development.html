To democratize application development, build a GUI developer tool based on Svete and its development tools. Svelte
provides ?easy? access to its AST tree,which can be used to hook in graphical tools. Svelte Dev Tools may be re-used if
possible. When combined with drag-and-drop (on event) action chain building, likely 80% of all UI functionality can be
covered by this. Underlying Svelte (Web development for the rest of us) implementation would allow to drop down to code
level and add what is required.

This combined with support for graphical (potentially natural language processing derived) creation of database schemas
and for @DetailScreen + @ListScreen "WYSIWYG" creation and editing (a la GraphQL UIs) and would allow for zero-code
building corresponding backends. Thus allowing laymen users to create Apps.

The secondary idea behind this is to come up with a set of components and a UI super-framework that can be reused if UIs
are switched and are compatible with it. This should make UI loading very fast, given that the data is already loaded
locally.

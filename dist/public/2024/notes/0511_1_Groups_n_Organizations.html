    Organizations often don't trust each other. Sometimes parts of the same organization don't trust
    each other. Sometimes different parts of the same organization trust different parts of external
    organizations more than they trust other parts of their own organization.

    To solve this a single rooted organization tree structure is introduced. All organizations originate
    from the same root but can have different permission walls. A permission system
    allows to share repositories of other organizations that are not parent organizations.

    Sometimes a cross cutting concern requires access to all repositories in all sub-organizations.
    To solve this a rank system is introduced (12 levels of 20). Some combination of these levels
    (and possibly steps within them) allows for cross cutting access. It is possible to allow
    limited access across organization roots (to elevated rank in organization requesting access).

    Think of the Orbital Fleet (as in the Solar system) that we will have one day. Every (at least
    major) country will have a branch of it. Alliances of countries will have branches as well. They
    all will be parts of Orbital Fleet but at the same time they serve their own national/alliance
    interests. So there must be a data sharing scheme that allows to correctly share what is needed
    without compromising national interests.

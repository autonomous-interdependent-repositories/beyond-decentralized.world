Actor signs transaction input.  This requires the same version of Repository (and its dependencies)
to be present on all devices that execute business logic (originally or for verification)

Peer-to-peer:
Terminals rely on the self-specified timestamps to order messages. If they exectute an operation
and earlier created data comes in they do conflict detection that will sync the data to the same
state across all devices.

In controlled environments the controlled Terminals are considered "the source of truth" and their
versions will override the versions created by peer-to-peer Terminals.

AIRport allows for off-line Repository modifications, which can lead to a multitude of sync-conflicts. These will be
automatically resolved but users will be presented with out of sync data until they are resolved.
<br>
<br>
To reduce data conflicts visible to the users the repositories will be split up into shards based on the first 128 bits
of their GUID. A given shard (a physical node) will handle all reads and writes for a given repository. This allows for:
<br>
<br>
Consistent repository history for non-private repositories. The Update Bun process will always get all Transaction Logs
for a given Repository in the right order.
Reduced need for update-time conflict resolution because the time order of Transaction History is guaranteed.
Faster Transaction Log validation and conflict resolution - all changes are guaranteed to be into the local ScyllaDB
database, and can be processed almost immediately after they are recorded there (otherwise an unknown timeout period
would be required for all nodes to sync or out of order records would be possible).
Consistent reads - there won't be out of sequence Transaction Log Entries (TLEs) coming to the client databases.
<br>
<br>
Sharding also allows for moving to WebSocket connections. This provides real-time data responses because it feeds the
data back to all interested clients without having to query ScyllaDB first. As soon as the write comes in it's echoed
back to all clients that are listening for that Repository. This enables writing multi-player real-time games on top of
TB (<a href="https://github.com/Past-The-War-Earth/the-struggle-continues-anew.xyz/">TSCA.XYZ</a> being the first one).
<br>
<br>
WebSockets should take up less server resources than long polling (that otherwise would be required) "<a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23314964/is-there-a-server-cost-to-using-websockets">provided your OS
    open file descriptor settings are high enough</a>" and optimizations are applied. With the move to WebSockets TB
becomes a real-time data framework.
<br>
<br>
For now just implement in Bun. Do NOT optimize data structures (do not create a contiguous byte array) unless absolutely
necessary. Once (and if) optimizations are required just re-write in Zig/ZZZ for optimal performance.

<br>
In a later release re-balancing of shards will be enabled to allow for more even distribution of load and outage
recoveries.
<br>
<br>
Going forward, when load-scaling it makes sense to subdivide the repository GUID fragments by the next significant byte
(and building up its Repository TLE last timestamp+sequence map as requests come in).

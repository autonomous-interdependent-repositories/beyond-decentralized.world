Useful in SSR.

Basically the queries that a given UI runs when it displays a
page can be recorded and it's output can be saved for quick 
display of that page later - in an SSR environment or even
on the client device.  So, instead of having to go through
loading several repositories and then progressively
constructing the view, it can be composed with a single
data call and no data processing at all.

This works really well for immutable views but also works
for views where data changes.  For example when the
data does change the combintation of all data that is
provied to the UI can be diffed against the previous version.
If it's different it can be updated.

This can be easily done in a server environment that
will crawl the data and have the permission to update the
Versioned View data result.

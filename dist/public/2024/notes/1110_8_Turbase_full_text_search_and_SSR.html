Full text search will rely on a hierarchy of repositories and will be done on the client side. The idea is to correctly
(sub-)group repositories and do an index on the metadata of each (sub-)group. Top level search will return the top level
groups (categories, organizations, etc) in all indexes. Subsequent searches would be done on navigation of that group
and within that group (on its sub-groups until the are the final source repositories).

The global text search can be provided by search engines, further enabled by SSR of public repositories. All initial
Apps will be written in Svelte and thus a simple SSR server will be sufficient. This also means that Yugabyte will also
be used for read-queries but only for SSR. Naturally this will reduce latency on first page loads.

When a user enters value into the search bar, an iframe (or if not possible a tab) with Google search can be shown that
will match the search, filtered down to turbase.app. Then when the user navigates in that frame/tab on page bootstrap
(of the loaded turbase.app page) a script will be run that will detect if this app can be loaded in the existing UI
iframe and if it can it will be. The idea is that if the underlying components and framework are already loaded, it's
simpler to just fetch the data and re-render the UI on the client (needs to be proven).

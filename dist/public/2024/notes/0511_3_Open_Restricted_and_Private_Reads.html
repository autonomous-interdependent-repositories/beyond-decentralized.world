Every repository can have either read access or write access or both 
granted to a given user.  Writes are really always creates, since
every update and deletion can be tracked from the transaction log.
This spitting th Create/Update/Delete permissions isn't really
necessary.

Some repositories can be wide open to the public.  Some must
be restricted to several groups and some can be contained in a single
group.  A given group may be able to modify a repository but possibly
several other selected groups may be able to view the repository,
without opening up the repository to the public.

Again, in the case of OrbFleet, a certain unit may be able to
make certain data modifications.  That unit may or may not be
intergovernmental but additional units in each country may have
read only access to this data.

Thus thre is a need for "Restricted" reads.

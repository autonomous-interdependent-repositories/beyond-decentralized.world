Manual Repository creation is very flexible but is difficult and error prone. And there are two use-cases that likely
cover 80% of all scenarios and vast majority of scenarios for simple apps:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Showing a screen for a particular related set of records</li>
    <li>Showing a listing summary of those record-sets. This summary is often chunked by a fixed number of records (ex.
        25, 50, 100)</li>
</ul>
These scenarios fit perfectly well with the goals of AIRport - a given Repository covering everything that is needed to
render a given screen. And, these scenarios can have a performant implementation in TB.
<br>
<br>
The implementation starts with annotating a given query with @DetailScreen(name="THE_SCREEN_NAME"). This query
determines the boundaries of a Repository and always returns a single root record. To make it work a corresponding a
'screenName' parameter to the ThatRootRecordDao.saveScreen(rootRecord, "THE_SCREEN_NAME") is provided (vs
".save(rootRecord)"). At development time the save call is compared to the corresponding query and is evaluated for
completion. If there are records that are missing a (development time) warning is issued. Optionally a
"required({...subQuery})" function or equivalent can be added that will throw an error if that part of the data tree is
missing from the ".save" parameters (or from the query results).
<br>
<br>
Similarly a @ListScreen(name="THE_SCREEN_NAME") will provide a way to automatically maintain a listing repository when
changes to the related @DetailScreen Repositories are made. @ListScreen will be driven by query parameters that
determine which @DetailScreen records are in it. When @ListScreen query is created the metadata for its corresponding
@DetailScreen record is modified and the marked query parameters are added. In addition to that the fields present in
the @ListScreen query results are also tracked. Thus when a detailed screen Repository is changed the corresponding
@ListingScreen is updated.
<br>
<br>
Build time checks can verify that a given @ListScreen query only references data from a given @DetailScreen.
<br>
<br>
@ListingScreen will be stored in chronological order all will break up into pages of listings as records come in. This
enabled loading very long listings in chunks. Additional pre-built filters are also possible, at the cost of additional
processing time & storage (and needing to maintain an insert/delete tree structure).
<br>
<br>
Along with TL storage, computed queryResult JSON representations (for open Repositoriesonly) can also be stored
(whenever a List or a Detail is added or modified). The front-end server can maintain an LRE cache of most frequently
used lists and details allowing for O(1) access time during usage spies for specific topics (this works because of
Repository GUID based sharding of front-end servers).
<br>
<br>
Thus, @DetailScreen and @ListScreen allow to build Apps that do not explicitly deal with the concepts Repository and do
not require custom modification logic (are purely query based).

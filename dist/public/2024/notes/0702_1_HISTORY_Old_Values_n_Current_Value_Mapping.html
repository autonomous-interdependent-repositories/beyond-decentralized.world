<h1>HISTORY: Old Values and Current Value Mapping</h1>
<br>
Old Value history (of the Repository Transaction log) is useful for showing users exactly what was changed in a given
Repository (and by who, what App, and when). This prevents data loss, adds accountability, and allows for historical
analysis. Previously Old Value history saved the actual previous value of the field. This can however be extremely
wasteful, especially with large data fields. The new approach is to point to the previous New Value. Most importantly,
without this change, it was not possible to trace back from a given Repository Block to the Block that was changed.
<br>
<br>
Old Value history only exists for the Trunk branch of a Repository. This saves processing and memory of the (potentially
ephemeral, with the database running in memory) non-trunk merge nodes (browser tabs), which won't have to compute Old
Values or the related Current Value Mappings (for the Repository branches they create). Thus, any node that becomes a
(Repository) Trunk merge node can easily pull Old Values in (along with the trunk version of the Repository). It is also
possible to load the Old Values subsequently if the part of the Trunk branch is already loaded.
<br>
<br>
For the purpose of looking up the current New Values (during an Update or Delete operation) a new "CurrentValueMapping"s
table is being created. It maintains all of the current value mappings for all of the Repositories (in a given
database). These records simply have a pointer to the New Value records they represent. These mappings are only needed
on the nodes that merge into (Repository) Trunk, since they are needed just for computing the "previous New Value"
pointers of the Old Value records. Current Value Mapping records can be computed by re-processing a Repository
Transaction Log. Alternatively, they can be tracked in the Transaction Log itself.
<br>
<br>
In practice, only server and Mobile App nodes would do Trunk merging. They would both be going off of a database that
has the Old Values and the Current Value Mappings pre-populated. When a new Repository is loaded on a different
organization's server (or a different community-shared geo-partition) or a Mobile App it makes sense to save the
computational cycles and load Current Value Mappings from the Transaction Log (instead of having to re-compute them).
However, this leads to the potential for data corruption (since Current Value Mappings are a derived entity). Thus,
given server-side or off-hours processing the (present) solution is to recompute Current Value Mappings on Trunk block
processing/creation.

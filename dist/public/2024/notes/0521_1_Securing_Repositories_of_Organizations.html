AIRport runs all operations directly on Terminals (user devices) this:
<br>
<br>
<nl>
    <li>Allows to verify that a given user indeed made the given (entire) modification to a Repository, via a given
        device and using the given Application.</li>
    <li>Allows the same user to make modifications to Repositories of multiple Organizations, without having to maintain
        passwords in all of those Organizations. This is possible because the change is signed by the
        User+Device+Application keys.</li>
    <li>Improves thetraceability of the made transactions.</li>
    <li>Allows users to work offline and sync their changes later.</li>
    <li>Reduces load on the Organization's infrastructure (for read queries, and by an order of magnitude) since all
        user queries are fulfilled from a wide-column database (with the relational structure reconstructed on the user
        devices).</li>
</nl>
<br>
This assumes Users are allowed remote access to Repositories at appropriate levels (maintained by Repository
permissions). This also assumes that they are using a verified Framework version. For example, if they are using an
in-browser, timestamped, seeded, and hash-summed version of the Framework (that uses this info to blockchain
transactions and does not persist to permanent storage locally). The seed can be communicated securely to pre-verified
Organizational servers by a mutually agreed upon (by all involved Organizations) authority.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Once Organizations start utilizing AIRport they will want to verify the data entered on user Terminals (Devices). This
is possible by adding several constraints on what data can be added to Organizational Repositories.
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Input into the operation sent along with the Repository Transaction Log entry.
<br>
<br>
To verify a modification to a Repository the Application logic must be re-run in a environment controlled by the
Organization. To do that the input (into the API that modified the Repository) will be saved (along with the resulting
Transaction Log entries) and sent to the Organization servers for re-running.
Organizations can peer review the Application code to ensure the validity of the modifying logic. That will ensure that
only approved Application Versions are used to create a Repository change. Application versions can be verified by the
verified Framework running on the devices, as well as seeded, hash-summed, and block-chained into the transaction.
<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Only Entity objects are allowed as inputs into Organizational Repository modifications.
<br>
<br>
This prevents data leakage both in and out of Repositories. Only Entities belonging to the given Repository will be
inserted/updated/deleted. Other (non-modified) passed-in records will be checked against the records on the
Organizational servers. The modified records will have only the modifications applied to the existing records on the
Organizational servers.
<br>
<br>
Thus, only the IDs for all Entities (the input objects) and the modified fields for the (modified) Entities (in the
modified Repository) will sent into the API.
<br>
<br>
At commit time an additional verification will ensure that all modifications found in the input objects are committed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Repositories can only reference records from lower-access level repositories.
<br>
<br>
A global scheme of Repository access level classification will allow for the safe sharing of data between repositories:
<br>
<br>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>51 - 60</td>
        <td>Internal Only</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>41 - 50</td>
        <td>Top Secret</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>31 - 40</td>
        <td>Secret</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>21 - 30</td>
        <td>Confidential</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>11 - 20</td>
        <td>Restricted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 - 10</td>
        <td>Inter-Organizational</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Public</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
An additional extension from 100 to 60,000 (times 100) can be allowed for finer grained access.
<br>
<br>
By default an Organizational Repository could only reference records from Public Repositories. Organizations would
establish relationships between themselves for higher-level access. Thus, if two Organizations established shared
Restricted access their Repositories could reference records from Restricted and below-level Repositories of the other
Organization. A one-way privilege elevation could also be possible with one Organization allowing Restricted and below
access and the other allowing Secret and below access. Manual (and recorded) override will be allowed on a per-User
basis.
Only the Entities from eligible Repositories would be allowed in the (modifying API) inputs.
<br>
<br>
<br>
4. All queries in modifyingAPI are checked.
<br>
<br>
Every query made during an API call (that modifies a Repository) limits the query results to only the valid set of
Repositories. Parameters of every (sub)query will guarantee that the results come from specific (valid) Repositories.
The outputted records will come only from the Repositories a given Repository depends on (this will be done by
augmenting query parameters).
<br>
<br>
<br>
5. On the originating Terminal, Input records are filtered
<br>
<br>
A given Transaction can modify multiple Repositories across multiple Organizational boundaries.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: If a Repository record (which is referenced from the modified Repository) is present at a Terminal then the
relationship between its Repository and the Repository being modified is also present.
<br>
<br>
Thus, only if there is a cross-Repository relationship (or an inter-Organization access level rule) will the records
from the inputted Repository be included in the API Input records (sent to the Organization's server).
<br>
<br>
<br>
6. Organizational server version overrides.
<br>
<br>
The new version of the Transaction generated by the Organization's server will override the sent-in version. The
inputting Terminal (and all other Terminals and servers) will subsequently merge the differences (if any).
<br>
<br>
<br>
7. Mutile Repositories of the same Organization
<br>
<br>
When multiple Repositories of the same Organization are modified in the same API call (for the same Transaction) they
all are sent in one batch. The GUID of the Repository with the highest ranking access level will be used for the key for
the (server side) message topic partition. If there are multiple Repositories with the top access level, the one changed
first (in chronological order) is used. This will ensure consistency and transactional atomicity if there are
dependencies between the modifications (to different Repositories of the same Organization).
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
NOTE: Organizational security also benefits personal/small group/serverless Repositories that also become more secure
(with each group being treated as an Organization).

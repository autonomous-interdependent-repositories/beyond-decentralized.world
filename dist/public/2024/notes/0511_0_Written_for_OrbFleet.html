    In 2015 I wrote "Hans the Organizator" - a family organizer.  Soon after I realized that giving family data to 3rd
    party companies for storage would tempt those companies to use it for their gain.  After thinking about it for a
    while I started working on AIRport which eventually developed from an Adator for storage in Google Docs to the
    now-developing Turbase network.
</p>
<p>
    The general idea behind Turbase is for families and small groups to share their data directly in a peer-to-peer
    fashion while maintaining backups on a shared file system of their choice.  Each personal device would be registered
    directly (perhaps via a modem noise signal over a voice call, or even more simply with a direct text message - with
    the additional security of a pre-agreed upon phrase entered into the App for encrypting the handshake), thus
    solving the distributed ID problem.
</p>
<p>
    However, not all data belongs to small groups of individuals.  Often data belongs to a community or an organization
    (like a church or even the state government).  And with shared data, there will be shared servers that will hold and
    index it.  This is where the idea of the Data Independence Network comes in.  With the idea that most user data
    belongs to the area where they live, each metro area establishes its own (de)centralized server farm where the data
    resides and applications run.  Multiple local organizations would utilize these server farms.  The Repository data
    would still be connected to data in other metro areas and shared computation would be done a la Maglev setup.
</p>
<p>
    Other organizations could also be plugged into this echo system, providing cross-cutting concerns that span a
    country, a continent, or the globe.
</p>
<p>
    But the world seems just fine with the way the data is right now.  Big companies are doing good enough of a job of
    both writing useful applications and hosting user data.  Independently written, cooperating Apps just don't appear
    to be needed at this point.  And there doesn't appear to be widespread abuse of the data that harms the users.  At
    least not enough to make users pay or watch Ads for private data storage.
</p>
<p>
    The same thing applies to the government - it's just fine with keeping all of the data and fully controlling all of
    the Apps that use it.
</p>
<p>
    But there is one use case where AIRport technology can be useful - a use case that will likely exist as soon as we
    get good enough to exploit asteroids - a global intergovernmental organization to oversee Solar system security. 
    Such an organization will be able to share some of the data between countries but not all of the data.  Applications
    written by other countries will be able to run securely, without causing national security problems for other
    countries.  Applications written by various countries will have to cooperate.  This is the perfect case for AIRport!

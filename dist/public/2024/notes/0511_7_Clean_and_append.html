Peer to peer:

Once all of the active Terminals with a Repository have shared a big
enough number of Transaction Log entries a suitable Terminal is chosen
to append the already shared log entries to a single file.

Thus an entire Repository is stored in a single file that is periodically
appended to.  This solves many issues with previous idea of maintaining
a nested set of directories and compacting it overtime.  The retrieval
of the entire repository becomes a single I/O + network operation,
breaking the previously percieved performance barrier problem.

If personal data is stored on an open network like Filecoin then the 
Repository file will be encrypted, regenerated every time and
completely replaced (with the old file being deleted).

In a shared environment the recent data is stored in ScyllaDb.  It
is periodically cleaned and appended to shared object storage (again
into one file per Repository).  Solves the server-side performance
problem.

A similar archival process can be done with Vesa full text search,
perhaps search entries for archived repositories will be removed.
Repositories could be auto-archived after a certain period of
inactivity.  This needs to be thought through more - the seed
apps for Turbase will have full text search as a secondary navigation
option and will be able to operate without it.  A small marker record
will be kept for future lookup.

Same goes for the CockroachDB RDBMS - archived repositories could be
removed into long term storage.  Here also a marker record will
be kept for future reference.

<h1>Trunk and Branch chains</h1>
<br>
In a decentralized environment, once there is a consensus that enough Terminals have reported their changes, a Secretary
Terminal is chosen. The Secretary Terminal will process all of the Branch chains, merge them into the Truck chain, and
(re)write (to) the Repository Transaction Log file.
<br>
<br>
The Trunk chain simply orders all of the blocks in the sub-chains. It is up to the nodes to run the conflict resolution
logic to arrive at the same dataset as the Trunk chain. This the result of the conflict resolution logic must always be
the same, no matter in what order the Branch chains are applied to a database.
<br>
<br>
In a server environment, all Branch chains come sequentially (given that the synchronization timestamp overwrites the
save timestamp and only one write node processes all Transaction log entries for a repository). The Transaction Log
compaction (into the Repository Transaction Log file) happens periodically (taking all recent records in a Column
database and appending them to the previous version of the file and subsequently removing them from the column
database).

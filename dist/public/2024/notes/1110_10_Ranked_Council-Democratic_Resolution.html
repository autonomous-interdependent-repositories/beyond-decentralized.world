The technical design of Application Usage system flows into a number of factors that evolved around AIRport and Turbase,
which together result in an implementable idea with potential for lasting value:
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://votecube.com/#!/poll/info/Cube/vote/kBSVLFHn01lMtvPXYIzu/4vz9cPyZiMoaGG4JOh6t">Votecube</a> was
inspired by a dream of a rotating cube, shimmering with changing bright colors that came with a "Give it to the
Children" directive. The following inspiration led to a collaborative development of the UI prototype and subsequent
discussions of the Votecube platform and the subsequently developed idea of the Sapoto.net project (the support
network).
At its core, Votecube is a polling mechanism that can gather public opinion. When combined with AIRport technology and
its (technologically driven) nested community approach it can become a Council based (with direct Democratic fall backs
at higher levels) community decision making system.
The core idea behind Council Democracy is progressive self governance. People naturally organized by their work or
their residence form councils that democratically govern their own affairs. Via an open vote system (everyone in the
council knows who voted for who, which provides bounded, electorate accountability) a representative is chosen to go to
the municipal level where a derived council is formed. The selected representative can be re-called back at any time by
the council that elected him (which provides representative accountability). This mutual accountability system can then
be applied one more level up (with municipal Councils electing representatives to regional Councils).
<br>
<br>
AIRport's Repository system of independent, interlinked repositories works well with having dedicated repositories to
each council and its deliberations and decisions. It solves the scalability problem of maintaining records - each
Repository is completely independent. At the same time Repositories provide a way to link together records of different
assemblies of the same council into one grouping.
<br>
<br>
The initial discussions of building an online community around Votecube ended up in the common realization that to build
a thriving community a ranking system will be required which would take into account the experience and time invested of
the individual contributors to the community.
<br>
<br>
Thus combining the Repository and Derived/Listing Repository concept of AIRport (which overlaps the multi-step council
system) with the seemingly undemocratic concepts of expertise and ranking can lead to a decision making system that can
solve any number of problems.
<br>
<br>
A good example is the need for reconciliation of Turbase benefits from Application and UI usage (whatever form they will
take). Any application can base its own screens on any number of other applications and any UI can call any Application
API. To prevent plagiarism (besides the requirement of a different Root Object for the query, belonging to the
Application building the new join Query) a system will be implemented where all of the up-stream Apps will be notified
of a to-be-published Application and can petition changes to the Application if it isn't adding enough value.
<br>
<br>
This petition will be community reviewed and voted upon based on any combination of factors (specified by the
petitioners and the defendant at least) that the community chooses as the deciding ones. But a simple count of votes
can be easily manipulated. Thus a balanced governance system will be developed that will take into account:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Opinions of the users using impacted applications (local popular council), weighted by their rankings and time
        present, opinions of the automatically picked to vote (from all impacted users) "elders" (most ranked most
        dedicated users) and (in high profile cases or voluntarily) weighted opinions of all users.
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical opinions of the Application Developers, based on their expertise in the domains related to the new
        Application (local expert council), technical opinions delegated to Application Developer representatives
        (higher level council), and optionally (in high profile cases or voluntarily) technical opinions of all
        Developers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Decisions of the governing assembly & if necessary decision of the steering council chosen from that
        assembly.TECH NOTE: Turbase keeps stats on user activity in public repositories (efficiently due to its modular
        and optionally hierarchical data storage nature). All AIRport Repositories share a common (likely
        cross-connected) knowledge tree. User participation stats will allow to track how much users have been
        contributing, over which time and in which knowledge sub-trees.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
TECH NOTE: Users rank posts/entries by other users in a Turbase wide shared (but partitioned and used for tracking only
in open Repositories) ranking schema/App, possibly on a multi-dimensional scape (adding emoji reactions). Theser
rankings aggregate overtime and are weighted by their participation in given knowledge sub-trees. Thus, this allows for
automatically selecting "elders" in given areas of concern.
<br>
<br>
TECH NOTE: Domain specific Applications are assign sub-knowledge trees. Cross domain Applications are assumed to cover
the entire knowledge tree. This allows to correctly (automatically) select "elders" that can vote on
Application-specific issues (such as approval for publishing).
<br>
<br>
TECH NOTE: Disputed Applications are allowed to execute on the platform for the purpose of evaluation (while not
collecting any benefits that would otherwise be split by all participating Apps and UIs) while the Resolution process is
ongoing.
<br>
<br>
BALANCE NOTE: Users represent the interest of the user echo-system. Does the UI/App add value to the users, often no
matter how fair it is to other Apps and UIs.
<br>
<br>
BALANCE NOTE: App Dev Council represents the interests of the Applications, including fair distribution benefit streams
and ability to develop further improvements vs ability to delegate separate domain concerns to other UIs/Apps
<br>
<br>
BALANCE NOTE: Governing assembly has the interests of the entire ecosystem as their primary concern.
<br>
<br>
NOTE: For expedience, the decisions made by the representatives quickly resolve the issue. If the decisions made by the
representatives prove to be out of sync with the decisions of their constituency, their vote can be reverted and their
ranking can be dropped (in more serious cases dropping them out of the status of representatives). This would apply at
all levels (3rd level representatives can be overruled and even recalled if there is sufficient, near unanimous
consensus by their 1st level constituency).
<br>
<br>
NOTE: User representatives gain their ranking based on ratings given by users. Application Developers have a
(professionally beneficial) virtual council and vote in/out their representatives. Assembly delegates are periodically
voted in by User Representatives (one sub-assembly) and Application Developer representatives (another assembly).
Steering council may not be needed in a virtual system.
<br>
<br>
SCALABILITY NOTE: Scaling such a decision system can be very hard due to the huge number of resources required to
maintain the necessary infrastructure. AIRport's hierarchical Repository design greatly limits the needed resources
(every council is an organization with a limited set of Repositories that reliate and derive vote counts
hierarchically), thus making an O(n^x) problem a O(x*log(n)) problem.
<br>
<br>
Thus even with a basic (albeit motivated) draft of a possible decision making system, a balanced democratic system is
becoming apparent that can be applied to any number of domains within or across any number of communities. Given
expected materialization of fusion energy and robotization and the resulting shift to work towards societal betterment,
there may be a need for such systems in the future (likely several decades away once the actualities of the resource and
social frameworks change as a result of underlying drivers).

Run Apps in the same process as the framework but lock down all network storage and DOM apis by polyfilling.
Do the same thing for the UI frame.

<br>
Also during the event capturing phase make sure no link ever submits data or navigates to an external URL. Do the same
thing for form submissions.
<br>
<br>
This gives the most flexibility to UI developers.

<br>
Add support for main frameworks so that direct dom access is gated (a core bundle for those frameworks would be
pre-packaged by AIRport and lazy loaded would be provided by App Developers.

Initial support - Svelte.

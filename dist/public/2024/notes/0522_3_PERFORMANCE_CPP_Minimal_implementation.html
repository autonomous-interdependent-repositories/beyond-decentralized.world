<h1>PERFORMANCE CPP - Minimal implementation</h1>
<br>
IF AND WHEN A C++ IMPLEMENTATION IS NEEDED:
<br>
<br>
The key benefit of the C++ version is compiling the framework together with QuickJS and SQLite into a single WASM file.
This would greatly improve framework load times and runtime performance.  This is even more important given that
Chrome unloads tabs from memory, requiring a full reload on tab switch.
<br>
<br>
The reference (TypeScript) implementation "dogfoods" wherever possible. C++ implementation should be coded for optimal
performance. Thus:
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Pre-define well-known internal queries in SQL strings.</li>
    <li>Re-write the query serialization logic to create a flat JSON object tree of the query definition as seen in the
        query definition code (very minimal). This will reduce the bundle size (and memory footprint) for every
        Application loaded via QuickJS.</li>
    <li>Re-write the query processing code in the framework to adjust for the new serialized format.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In general, simplify the C++ version to improve runtime performance and memory footprint. This should also result in
lower initial load times but that isn't a goal in and of itself.

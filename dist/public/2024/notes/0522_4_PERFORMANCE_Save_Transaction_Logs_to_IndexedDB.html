<h1>PERFORMANCE - Save Transaction Logs to IndexedDB</h1>
<br>
For the in-browser version:
<br>
<br>
Chrome unloads tabs when the user navigates away from them. To reduce tab-reload time save all Transaction Log entries
in the database into IndexedDB. On tab-reload, first load from IndexedDB, and only then check over the network.
<br>
<br>
Save the RepositoryBlock.data into IndexedDB, instead of in the database.
<br>
<br>
To begin with (may change later): Do not save insert into the RepositoryTransactionHistory and lower entities. The data
is already recorded in the RepositoryBlock.data and no analytical processing will be done in the in-browser apps.
